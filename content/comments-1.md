### 4. Comments

- Clear and expressive code with few comments is better than cluttered and complex code with lots of comments. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Hard to maintain. Most of the time, when the code moves, comments don't always follow it. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Hard to test. Better explain what you need in the code. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The older the comments are, the less likely they will be true. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
