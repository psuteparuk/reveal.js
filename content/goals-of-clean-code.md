### Goals of Clean Code

- **Reliability** <span class="fragment">- The system continues to work <span class="text-primary">correctly</span> even in the face of adversity.</span>
- **Scalibility** <span class="fragment">- As the system <span class="text-primary">grows</span>, there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.</span>
- **Maintainability** <span class="fragment">- Over the time, many different people will work on the system, and they should all be able to work on it <span class="text-primary">productively</span>.</span>
