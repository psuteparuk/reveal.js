# Writing Clean Code

This is the presentation I first gave on September 1, 2017 at Paradise Digital, Co., Ltd. as part of the bi-weekly tech talk. The focus of the talk is on why engineers should always strive to write clean code even when facing adversities such as a tight schedule and unrealistic requirements. We discuss some characteristics of a clean code and strategies to achieve them.
